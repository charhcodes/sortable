# Sortable - Your Least Favourite Superhero Database
A simple website in Javascript created as part of the 01 Founders Javascript 3-week sprint, which sorts and allows the user to search through a [superhero API database](https://rawcdn.githack.com/akabab/superhero-api/0.2.0/api/all.json).

## Installation
This website must be hosted locally, I recommend using a live server extension for easy use.

## Usage
The searchbar allows users to search through the characters. Pretty self-explanatory. 
The database is sorted from A-Z by default, but this can be changed (for instance, in order of intelligence from smallest to largest) by clicking the corresponding arrow buttons under the relevant table header. 
The site also allows for pagination, and the amount of results shown per page can be adjusted above the character table.
